# Old Bukkit Projects
This project contains many Bukkit / Spigot projects made by me when I started in the programming world.

Therefore, I do not recommend that you use most of the code hosted here. If you want to use it anyway, I highly recommend that you review them.

Most (if not all) of them do not even follow the object-oriented paradigm, and several grotesque errors that would drive an analyst mad are present here.
